      <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

      <dl>
        <dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
        <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas
          walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>
        <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
        <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping
          experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are
          located in the lodge.</dd>
        <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
        <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of
          clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
